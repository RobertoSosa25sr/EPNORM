# EPNORM

This is a prototype for an aplication that allows anfitrions and guests to rent offices in a building. 

## Account Creation

1. The user provides a name, a phone number, an email and a password.
2. The user is asked to confirm the email.
3. The user is asked to confirm the phone number.
4. The user is asked to confirm the password.


## Identity Verification

1. The user is asked to upload a document that proves their identity.
2. The user is asked to open the camera and take a picture of their face.


## Property Registration

1. The user is asked to upload a document that proves the ownership of the property they want to rent.
2. The user is asked to upload a video of the property.

## Property Publication
1. The user is asked to select  a registrated property.
2. The user is asked to select the available dates and houres, the price per hour and the number of  maximum guests.


## Booking

1. The user is asked to select the property they want to rent.
2. The user is asked to select the date of the booking.
3. The user is asked to select the start time of the booking.
4. The user is asked to select the end time of the booking.
5. The user is asked to select the number of guests.
6. The user can talk to the host through the app in order to ask for more information if needed.
7. The user confirms the booking.
7. The user has to wait for the host to confirm the booking.


## Payment

1. The user is asked to enter the payment data (Solidity smart contract)
2. The user is asked to confirm the payment.
3. Once the payment is confirmed the user can cancel the booking 30 minutes before the booking starts.
4. If the user cancels the booking the payment is refunded.
5. If the host cancels the booking the user is refunded.


## Considerations 

METODOLOGIA DE IMPLENTACIÓN
Enfoque utilizado:Agile + CI/CD → Desarrollo iterativo y despliegue continuo.Smart Contracts en Solidity → Automatización de reservas y pagos.Blockchain híbrida (On-chain + Off-chain) → Eficiencia y escalabilidad.
Pasos clave:Desarrollo inicial → Creación de COIN (ERC-20), billetera interna y smart contracts en testnet.Pruebas y optimización → Simulación de costos, seguridad y experiencia de usuario.Despliegue y escalabilidad → Implementación en mainnet y optimización con zk-Rollups.Monitoreo y mejoras → Integración de IA para seguridad y predicción de fraudes.Expansión y monetización → Adopción en LATAM y conversión a moneda real.
